# ImparaScript
Welcome to my learning playground! This repository contains a collection of simple programs and scripts that I developed to learn the basics of shell scripting, automation, and other programming concepts. Each project serves as a hands-on exercise to help me understand new tools and techniques, and they're all intended for educational purposes.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and even suggest improvements. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we all learn together!
